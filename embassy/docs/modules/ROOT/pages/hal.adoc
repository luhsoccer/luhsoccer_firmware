= Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Embassy provides HALs for several microcontroller families:

* `embassy-nrf` for the nRF microcontrollers from Nordic Semiconductor
* `embassy-stm32` for STM32 microcontrollers from ST Microelectronics
* `embassy-rp` for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontrollers

These HALs implement async/await functionality for most peripherals while also implementing the
async traits in `embedded-hal-async`. You can also use these HALs with another executor.
